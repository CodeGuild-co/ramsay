         <h3>What I want to get out of this course:</h3> 
         <p>•	To develop my knowledge of programming and software engineering
•	To gain a foothold and basic knowledge of PHP
•	To find out the meaning of the mystical group: “ARM”
•	To come up with a good team name based off the PHP initialise (this is a top priority atm)
•	TO WIN. (this is the ultimate goal obviously)
•	Further my understanding of the applications of computer science
</p> 
<p>I should probably put down “meeting new people” but that seemed a bit cliché so I’ll leave it out for now.</P>
